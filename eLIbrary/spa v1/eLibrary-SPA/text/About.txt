            The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
            (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. <br />
            A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless
            filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
           
            The eLibrary® database has been completely re-imagined, with a redesigned experience that 
            more efficiently guides novice researchers to identify their research topic and find authoritative 
            information to support their research claim. Presented on the award-winning ProQuest platform, eLibrary 
            offers two methods of access: a custom Guided Research application, and as part of the unified platform, 
            assuring fit-for-purpose use. The responsively-designed user interface offers access on any device at any time. 
            and, users can cross-search eLibrary with other ProQuest databases, improving your library’s return-on-investment.

            digital media content designed to support every range of users, including middle and high school students, college-prep and college-level

            Common Core State Standards. eLibrary’s updated interface and features make research easy. Researchers will find the answers they need from 
            more than 2,090 full-text magazines, newspapers, books, and transcript titles, plus a collection of over 7 million maps, pictures, weblinks,
